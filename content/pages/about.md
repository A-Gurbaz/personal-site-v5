👋 Hi, I’m Yoav. 

🛫 I'm based in Tel-Aviv. I previously lived / worked in NYC, and visited Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Egypt, England, Germany, Guatemala, Hungary, Italy, India, Mexico, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Panama, Poland, Spain, Turkey and United States.

👨‍💻 I work as a payments nerd at [Melio](https://www.meliopayments.com). I'm in tech since 2012, previusly worked for [Britannica Knowledge Systems](https://www.britannica-ks.com/), [WalkMe](https://www.walkme.com/), [CinchWallet](https://shopcinchwalletin.com/) and [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com). From time to time advise tech companies how to optimize and scale their billing systems efficiently.

👍 I like tech, coffee, books, football, yoga, and cooking. I thrive when I’m building things from scratch. I enjoy forming relationships with people. I'm an inquisitive person that loves deep-diving into complex concepts and becoming a subject-matter expert.

💅 I'm the maker of [Polishapp](https://polish.launchaco.com/) (alongside [Sharon Rubinstein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharon-rubinstein/)), a niffty tool for web-writers. It turns your browser into a powerful type-writing machine, that allows you to edit text on _any_ webpage, experience your edits in the site layout, and share it with colleagues for feedback.

💭 This is a place where I can blurb about anything. The opinions expressed here are my own and do not represent the views or opinions of my employer.
