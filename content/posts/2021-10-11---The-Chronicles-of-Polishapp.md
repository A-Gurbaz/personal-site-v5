Hands-down [Polishapp](https://polish.launchaco.com/) is one of the most exciting things I've built. It is a project [Sharon Rubinstein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharon-rubinstein/), and I started in April 2021. Since its launch, we have acquired 1000 users predominantly through community and word-of-mount. It was featured on multiple newsletters and UX Writing sites. It was shared by UX Writing professionals on Twitter and LinkedIn. In Jan 2022, Polishapp was [microacquired](https://microacquire.com/). This is a journal logging the key milestones and learnings.

## First, What is Polish?
- **The short version:**
A tool for the people who write the web. It turns your browser into a mean type-writing machine that lets you rewrite web pages in seconds.

- **The extended version:**
A Chrome extension for UX writers, Content Designers, Product Marketers, and Content Marketers. Usually, these professionals don't have access to design tools like Figma, especially if they are external consultants. If they are assigned to re-word existing pages, they can rarely get an up-to-date version of that page in Figma. Their process is highly collaborative and includes working with professionals from other disciplines like Design, Engineering, Legal, etc. Their changes go through multiple rounds of approval. They will often receive feedback about how the new copy sits within the site layout.
Polish makes this process easier by turning web pages to be editable. 
When editing pages using Polish, you know you're working on the source of truth. Changes are immediately reflected in the site's layout. It allows sharing your revisions with others and toggling between the original text and your text.
It is handy because this method of work supports their creative process and trims down communication inefficiencies with design and engineering.
