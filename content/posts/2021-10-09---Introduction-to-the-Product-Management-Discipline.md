The following write-up is the first-ever I published online. At the time, I was unemployed, recently relocated to a new country, and was trying to reflect on the last few years I worked in product. In hindsight, this was a self-exploration of whether I want to continue this path as a career.

It was initially published in a small subreddit in late 2018, [r/productmanagment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/), and some months after publishing I shared it on [Medium](https://medium.com/@A-Gurbaz/intro-pm-discipline-7f2ab088013f). 

While I don’t agree with most of the below anymore, some still hold for me.  _I only made minor editorial changes for typos, spelling, and grammar._

In recent months, as part of my job hunt, I was sharpening my product thinking. To do that, I decided to read many materials online. While searching for good resources to read, I noticed that most articles focus on the job itself. For example, interview and hiring tips, best tools and frameworks, how to succeed as a PM, and the list goes on.

I found only a handful of articles about the discipline of product management. So I decided to write something of my own. In this post, I’ll give an overview of what I understand as the product management discipline. And describe how PMs are practicing it in their day-to-day.

# The Job is Owning Market Opportunities
> "A market opportunity is a situation in which consumers need (or want) a product, service, etc., yet it is not supplied."

Supplying this need will increase the value of a product. This increased value then translates to an increase in the supplier’s revenue. As I see it, modern product management is the art of owning these opportunities for a company. 

This process consists of four parts:
1. Identifying an opportunity,
2. Measuring the effect of capturing this opportunity,
3. Articulating the opportunity, and
4. Managing the ways to seize this opportunity.

## Identifying an Opportunity
There are many tools product managers use to identify an opportunity. I’ll name a few:
- Market Intuition — groom your knowledge in the market and expect what consumers want or need.
- User Interviews — meet with users and hear firsthand how they use the product to uncover hidden needs.
- Looking at the Competition — review other products to understand how others read the market.

## Measuring the Effect
Now you have a lead you think would be good to pursue. But how do you know it’s viable? How do you prove this investment is worthwhile? Here are a few examples of what PMs do:
- Market Knowledge — use available information about your market. What is the market size? What is the target group size? Who are the individuals within this group? What are the current alternatives?
- Company Goals — does this idea connects with the vision and goals of your company?
- Top-line Metric — mitigating this problem has any effect on your most important metric? How much?

## Articulating the Opportunity
A concise definition of the opportunity serves as “true north,” as it points on the _“what”_ and the _“why.”_ It should explain the vision and core principles of what you want to achieve and why it is not working right now. It will help justify the investment of resources and rally the team around the importance of the project.

_An easy-to-understand explanation on how to draft a problem statement exists on wikiHow!_

## Managing the Solution(s)
Product Managers are responsible for the project’s result and success. Yet, they are not the owners of the solution. They should help their team to come up with solutions. But at the same time, avoid questions about how to build the solution, as it is the work of other ICs. They should make critical decisions during this time but also consider the range of opinions about why to take (or not to take) a particular road. Some example decisions:
- Prioritization of work,
- Choosing solution A in favor of solution B,
- Describing the desired functionality,
- Etc.

Their work doesn’t stop after the solution is deployed. PMs will use KPIs to determine if the project had any success and to confirm their hypothesis. Some examples:
- Top-line Metric — did the solution had any effect on the most important metric? Is it a positive effect?
- Adoption — do users work with this solution? Who are these users?
- Growth — is there an increase in user acquisition? Can you attribute this increase to your solution? How?

Answering these questions allows PMs to provide data back to their team. This initiates an iterative process of improving the solution. And, at times, even drive a decision to deprecate it.
