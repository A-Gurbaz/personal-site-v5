Here I’ll list the ways I’m able to help.

The short version is — feel free to reach out if:
- You are just starting to build your payments infrastructure or choosing your payments stack.
- You have your payments infrastructure and stack, but they are not performing as you think they should.
- You are trying to break into product management, and you have previous experience working closely with customers either in a technical role or relationship management.
- You are in the first few years of your product management career and need advice.

You can find my contact information on the sidebar.
